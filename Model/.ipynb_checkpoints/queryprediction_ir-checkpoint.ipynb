       "['Virginia Tech wide receiver Danny Coale was lightly recruited out of Episcopal in Alexandria but has teamed with Jarrett Boykin for a record-breaking receiving duo . NEW ORLEANS — Now that Boykin and Coale have only Tuesday ’ s Sugar Bowl remaining before leaving Virginia Tech with every major school record for a wide receiver , they ’ ve taken a different stance . “ I still don ’ t think that was on us . Macho Harris was in the game and he lined up wrong , ” said Boykin , as Coale sat next to him nodding in agreement . Just add that to the list of slights these seniors have had to overcome . Coale , an Episcopal High graduate , leads Virginia Tech with 785 receiving yards this year . He is right behind Boykin in the school record books and became the team ’ s starting punter by the end of this season . Coach Frank Beamer has frequently marveled how “ Danny just always seems to be open. ” “ It ’ s great playing wide receiver here because once we throw the ball , you have opportunities to get big chunks of yardage . What we can ’ t do is we ’ re not going to catch 100 balls for 1,500 yards and 22 touchdowns. ” The other issue is that neither has the sort of attention-grabbing personality or pedigree associated with big-time wide receivers these days . Coale has graduated with a degree in finance and was named the ACC ’ s top scholar-athlete this year . He speaks in measured tones reminiscent of a CEO and has yet to join Facebook or Twitter . Boykin is so quiet around the team facility that Beamer said he sometimes doesn ’ t notice him until he ’ s making catches on the practice field or in games . Coming out of high school , Coale was barely recruited . Before showing up to a camp in Blacksburg one summer , his only scholarship offer was from VMI , where his father is the head of strength and conditioning . Coale still jokes that when he spent his redshirt year on the scout team , former Virginia Tech wide receivers and future NFL wideouts Eddie Royal , Andre Davis and Josh Morgan “ must have thought I was a walk-on . I prefer to just fly under the radar. ” But their accomplishments haven ’ t gone unnoticed now that the clock is ticking on their careers . Quarterbacks coach Mike O ’ Cain said Thomas ’ s comfort level during his record-setting first year under center is a direct reflection of Boykin and Coale . “ Not only are they gon na run the right route with the right timing , you know they ’ re gon na catch the ball , ” he said . Years of lining up together has also created a special bond between the two , and it played out before the ACC championship game this year . Boykin']"

       "'Virginia Tech wide receiver Danny Coale  was lightly recruited out of Episcopal in Alexandria but has teamed with Jarrett Boykin for a record-breaking receiving duo.  NEW ORLEANS — Now that Boykin and Coale have only Tuesday’s Sugar Bowl remaining before leaving Virginia Tech with every major school record for a wide receiver, they’ve taken a different stance. “I still don’t think that was on us. Macho Harris was in the game and he lined up wrong,” said Boykin, as Coale sat next to him nodding in agreement. Just add that to the list of slights these seniors have had to overcome. Coale, an Episcopal High graduate, leads Virginia Tech with 785 receiving yards this year. He is right behind Boykin in the school record books and became the team’s starting punter by the end of this season. Coach Frank Beamer has frequently marveled how “Danny just always seems to be open.” “It’s great playing wide receiver here because once we throw the ball, you have opportunities to get big chunks of yardage. What we can’t do is we’re not going to catch 100 balls for 1,500 yards and 22 touchdowns.” The other issue is that neither has the sort of attention-grabbing personality or pedigree associated with big-time wide receivers these days. Coale has graduated with a degree in finance and was named the ACC’s top scholar-athlete this year. He speaks in measured tones reminiscent of a CEO and has yet to join Facebook or Twitter. Boykin is so quiet around the team facility that Beamer said he sometimes doesn’t notice him until he’s making catches on the practice field or in games. Coming out of high school, Coale was barely recruited. Before showing up to a camp in Blacksburg one summer, his only scholarship offer was from VMI, where his father is the head of strength and conditioning. Coale still jokes that when he spent his redshirt year  on the scout team, former Virginia Tech wide receivers and future NFL wideouts Eddie Royal, Andre Davis and Josh Morgan “must have thought I was a walk-on. I prefer to just fly under the radar.” But their accomplishments haven’t gone unnoticed now that the clock is ticking on their careers. Quarterbacks coach Mike O’Cain said Thomas’s comfort level during his record-setting first year under center is a direct reflection of Boykin and Coale. “Not only are they gonna run the right route with the right timing, you know they’re gonna catch the ball,” he said. Years of lining up together has also created a special bond between the two, and it played out before the ACC championship game this year. Boykin was supposed to deliver the pregame speech, but always reticent about public speaking, he was afraid he might stutter and not be taken seriously. He asked Coale to take his place. “I’ve been through his struggles, he’s been through mine,” Coale said. “He’s a guy that I know I can count on, whether it’s five years from now, I just know I can count on him and he’ll be there. I know when I look back, part of my Tech experience is going to be him.”'"
